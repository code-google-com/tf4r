Recently (march 2010) I came upon this blog: <a href='http://www.fabiensanglard.net/Prototyp/index.php'>Shoot'Em Up with LWJGL by Fabien Sanglard</a>.

I downloaded the project and found the content very interesting compared to other tutorials I could found before. Moreover with the textures available and all the work present I thought I could try...

Now what could I do? And very quickly I found: a _Thunder Force IV_ spin-off.

Since the project is made for fun and not for commercial use, I decided to post my first attempt.
